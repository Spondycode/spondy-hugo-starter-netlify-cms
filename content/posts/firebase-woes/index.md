T﻿rying to get a **FlutterFlow** app working and getting nowhere fast. I wanted to add some data to a Firebase document from a form I had set up in the app. Could not work out how to get the simple bit of text to go where I wanted it to go to.

I﻿'d write more, but it would just be a lot of moaning. Besides I'm so tired I can hardly keep my eyes open.
