## Doing this through the Netlify CMS and I like it.

 The photo above is at my favourite beach.

I have tried a few ways to get up and running with the Hugo blogging platform and so far this is the one I like the best. The CMS is easy to use although maybe a little too simple. I can also make changes using my editor of choice, Neovim, which I get at through the terminal.
